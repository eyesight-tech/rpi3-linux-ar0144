Raspberry Pi GPIO expander

The Raspberry Pi 3 GPIO expander is controlled by the VC4 firmware. The
firmware exposes a mailbox interface that allows the ARM core to control the
GPIO lines on the expander.

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "raspberrypi,firmware-gpio"
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller
- #gpio-cells : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number, and
  the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
  0 = active high
  1 = active low
- firmware : Reference to the RPi firmware device node

Example:

expgpio: expgpio {
	compatible = "raspberrypi,firmware-gpio";
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
	firmware = <&firmware>;
};
